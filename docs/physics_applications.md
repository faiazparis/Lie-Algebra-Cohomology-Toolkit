# Physics Applications (Scaffold)

- H² and H³ dimensions serve as structural proxies (e.g., anomaly-related structures, central charge dimension).
- The toolkit does not automate full anomaly calculations or invariant polynomials.
- Extend by adding domain-specific physics postprocessors that consume cohomology and spectral outputs.
