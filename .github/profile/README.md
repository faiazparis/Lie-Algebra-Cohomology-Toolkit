# Lie Algebra Cohomology Toolkit

A mathematically rigorous toolkit for computing Lie algebra cohomology and performing spectral analysis on the Hodge Laplacian of cochains.

## What it does
- **Computes Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology** with trivial coefficients
- **Performs spectral analysis** of the Hodge Laplacian on cochains
- **Validates algebraic consistency** (d²=0, Jacobi identity)
- **Supports policy-based computation** for different mathematical contexts

## Key features
- ✅ **Mathematically rigorous**: Implements exact CE differential with proper wedge permutation signs
- ✅ **Policy transparency**: Choose between standard CE cohomology and application-specific needs
- ✅ **Robust numerics**: SVD-based rank estimation for reliable Betti number computation
- ✅ **Open source**: Community-driven development with clear documentation

## Use cases
- **Physics**: Anomaly detection in gauge theories, central extensions
- **Robotics**: Attitude estimation on SO(3)/SE(3), stability analysis
- **Signal processing**: Operator family validation, deformation analysis
- **Deep learning**: Equivariant architecture consistency checking

## Quick start
```bash
pip install lie-algebra-cohomology-toolkit
lie-cohomology run -c config.yaml
```
